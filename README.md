# Features

- Send multiple payloads to multiple target URLs automatically
- Analyze HTTP responses for:
  - Reflected payloads
  - Blocked or error responses
  - Unusual delays (e.g., time-based attacks)
- Generate detailed reports in `.json` and `.csv` format
- Print summary results with Passed / Blocked / Suspicious payloads

# Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- This project requires the `requests` library. You can install it using:
 ```bash
 pip install requests
 ```

---

# Possible Improvements

- Add support for detecting more vulnerability types, such as SQL injection or remote code execution
- Export results to formats like HTML, PDF, or interactive dashboards
- Improve scanning speed using multithreading or asynchronous requests
- Enhance error detection and response classification accuracy
- Integrate alert notifications via email, Slack, or webhooks
- Develop a user-friendly interface using a desktop or web-based GUI


---

# Use Cases

- Educational use for learning web security testing and payload analysis
- Practice in CTF competitions or controlled lab environments
- Automating repetitive tasks in web vulnerability testing
- Building a prototype for red-team tools or larger security platforms
- Teaching how to analyze responses and identify common web vulnerabilities
